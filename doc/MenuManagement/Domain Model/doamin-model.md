To identify the **domain model** for the Menu Management system based on the functional and non-functional requirements, we need to break down the core concepts and entities involved in the system. A domain model represents the main entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.

### **Domain Model Entities**

### **Relationships Between Entities**

- **MenuItem** belongs to a **Category**.
- **Category** contains many **MenuItems**.
- **Menu** contains many **Categories** and **MenuItems**.
- **MenuItem** has a **Price**, potentially in different **Currencies**.
- **MenuItem** can have translations in different **Languages**.
- **User** (Admin) manages **MenuItems** and **Categories**.
- **User** (Customer) interacts with **MenuItems** via **Order**.
- **Inventory** is linked to **MenuItems** for real-time availability.
- **AuditLog** tracks changes made to **MenuItems**, **Categories**, and **Menus**.
- **POSIntegration** integrates menu items with external POS systems.

### **Diagram Overview**

1. **Entities**: MenuItem, Category, Menu, Price, Language, Order, User, Inventory, POSIntegration, AuditLog.
2. **Relationships**:
   - Menu has many Categories.
   - Category has many MenuItems.
   - MenuItem has one Price and many Languages.
   - User (Admin) manages Menu, Categories, and MenuItems.
   - Inventory relates to MenuItems for availability.
   - Orders are linked to MenuItems for customer interactions.
   - POSIntegration connects the system with external ordering platforms.

This model identifies the core entities and relationships required for a robust Menu Management system, fulfilling both functional and non-functional requirements.
