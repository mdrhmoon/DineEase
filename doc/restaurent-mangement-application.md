### **2. Plan the Architecture**

#### **A. Technology Stack**

1. **Frontend** (For web and mobile interfaces):
   - **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for building the web interface.
   - **React.js** or **Vue.js** for building the customer, admin, and staff dashboards.
   - **React Native** or **Flutter** for mobile apps (if required).

2. **Backend** (For handling the business logic, APIs, and database):
   - **Node.js** with **Express.js** (JavaScript), or
   - **Python** with **Django**/**Flask**, or
   - **Java** with **Spring Boot**, or
   - **Ruby on Rails**.

3. **Database**:
   - **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL** for structured data (e.g., menu items, orders, customer data).
   - **MongoDB** for unstructured or dynamic data (if needed).

4. **Authentication**:
   - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for token-based authentication.
   - **OAuth 2.0** if integrating with third-party services.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Use **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, **Heroku**, or **DigitalOcean** for deployment.
   - Set up **Docker** for containerization.

6. **Real-Time Communication** (for order tracking, live updates):
   - **WebSockets** or libraries like **Socket.io** to provide real-time updates for orders and kitchen staff.

7. **Payment Gateways**:
   - **Stripe**, **PayPal**, or **Square** for handling online and in-store payments.

### **3. Database Design**

Design the database by identifying the key entities and their relationships.

#### **A. Tables**
1. **Users**:
   - Fields: `user_id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`, `contact_info`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.

2. **Menu Items**:
   - Fields: `item_id`, `name`, `category`, `description`, `price`, `is_available`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.

3. **Orders**:
   - Fields: `order_id`, `customer_id`, `waiter_id`, `table_id`, `total_amount`, `status`, `created_at`.

4. **Order_Items**:
   - Fields: `order_item_id`, `order_id`, `item_id`, `quantity`, `subtotal`.

5. **Reservations**:
   - Fields: `reservation_id`, `customer_id`, `table_id`, `reservation_time`, `status`, `created_at`.

6. **Tables**:
   - Fields: `table_id`, `capacity`, `status` (available, reserved, occupied), `created_at`, `updated_at`.

7. **Inventory**:
   - Fields: `item_id`, `ingredient_name`, `quantity`, `reorder_level`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.

8. **Payments**:
   - Fields: `payment_id`, `order_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `payment_status`, `created_at`.

#### **B. Relationships**
- A `User` can have multiple roles (admin, chef, waiter, customer).
- A `Customer` can place multiple `Orders`.
- A `Reservation` can have multiple `Orders` linked to it.
- An `Order` contains multiple `Menu Items`.

### **4. Develop the Frontend**

#### **A. Admin Dashboard**
- **Menu Management**: Add, update, delete menu items. Toggle availability.
- **Order Management**: View current orders, change statuses (pending, in-progress, ready, delivered).
- **Inventory Management**: View inventory levels, set reorder alerts.
- **Reports**: Generate daily/weekly/monthly sales, inventory, and performance reports.

#### **B. Waiter/Chef Interface**
- **Order Display**: Show real-time orders from customers, linked to specific tables or delivery.
- **Kitchen View**: Display orders in progress and update statuses when ready.
- **Table Status**: Track the availability and status of tables (occupied, reserved, available).

#### **C. Customer Interface**
- **Menu View**: Show available dishes with descriptions, prices, and daily specials.
- **Reservations**: Allow customers to book a table for a specific time.
- **Place Order**: Enable customers to place dine-in, take-out, or delivery orders.

- Send live notifications to the kitchen staff when new orders are placed.

#### **B. Notifications**
- Implement push notifications or email/SMS alerts for customers when their table is ready, their order is prepared, or their delivery is on its way.

---

### **7. Testing**

#### **A. Unit and Integration Testing**
- Test individual components, such as menu management, orders, and payments.
- Use frameworks like **Jest**, **Mocha**, or **PyTest** for backend unit testing.

#### **B. End-to-End Testing**
- Use tools like **Selenium** or **Cypress** for testing the entire user journey from ordering to payment.

#### **C. Load and Performance Testing**
- Test for scalability to ensure the system can handle high traffic during peak hours.
- Use tools like **Apache JMeter** or **Gatling** for load testing.

---

### **8. Deployment and Maintenance**

#### **A. Cloud Deployment**
- Deploy the app to a cloud platform like **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, or **Heroku**.
- Set up a production environment with **Nginx** as a reverse proxy, **SSL certificates** for secure HTTP, and **Docker** for containerization.

#### **B. Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)**
- Automate testing and deployment using **GitHub Actions**, **Jenkins**, or **CircleCI**.

#### **C. Security**
- Implement SSL for secure communication.
- Regularly update and patch dependencies to prevent vulnerabilities.
- Implement rate-limiting, captcha, and input validation to avoid attacks like **DDoS** and **SQL Injection**.
